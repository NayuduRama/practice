                In this project, I combined React, Node.js, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a full-stack, full-featured website, including user-friendly forms for posting articles and comments. I created an interface from React components, develop a Node.js server, tie in a MongoDB database, and deploy the site on Amazon Web Services. By combining the front-end UI with a back-end solution and cloud hosting, I built powerful and interactive full-stack applications. Full-stack web applications that are truly interactive.
